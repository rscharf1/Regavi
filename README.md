# What is Regavi?
Regavi is a tech startup on the Washington University in St. Louis campus. Regavi is a smart contacts app for iOS and Android. It eliminates  the annoying task of sharing contact and social media information with others. Simply share your "OneTag" or allow others to scan your "DigiCard" to immediately have all the information you are comfortable sharing with them. This might include sharing your email and LinkedIn information with your boss, or exchanging Instagram accounts with friends. To learn more about what the app does, visit my website!

# My Role
I became involved with Regavi in the fall of 2018, during my freshman year at Washington University. As a Website and Software Developer Intern at Regavi, my first job was to create the website for the app. This is what this repository is for. I am the only member of the 10-perso team with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so this website is being made on my own. In time, as I become more experienced with Swift, I will be contributing to the iOS version of the app. I encourage you to check out the app on either the App Store or Google Play Store.
